# nlp-amazon-reviews
Sentiment classification on Amazon product reviews (positive/neutral/negative), comparing classic TF-IDF + SVM, static embeddings (Word2Vec / GloVe / FastText) with neural models, and a fine-tuned DistilBERT baseline. Includes explainability with SHAP and gradient-based attribution to inspect model behavior, especially on the neutral class.
